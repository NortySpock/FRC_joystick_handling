This code demonstrates a small pet project I have had for the gyroscope 
installed on our FIRST Robotics robot. The idea is that there will be an 
option on the driver's controls that, when held down, drives the robot 
only in a straight line. 

To do that we need to 
(1) normalize the two joystick inputs to a single power level and
(2) Take the gyro input and apply that power level to the wheels
(2a) with a modifier that slows the leading wheel.

This code demonstrates that behavior; there should only be minor tweaks 
needed to put it into a robot.
